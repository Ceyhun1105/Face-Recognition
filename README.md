# Face-Recognizer

Hello,
In this code, you need to download the libraries first. You may have difficulty downloading the face_recognition library on Google Colab. For this, you can Runtime>Change runtime type>hardware accelerator> select GPU. Or Edit>Notebook Settings>Hardware accelerator > select GPU. Then download the libraries. I used the photos in my own COLAB, you can download the second part of code and give its name correctly. I put a button to take the photo when the camera opened. Take the picture by pressing it.
